            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>How did you meet?
</strong></p><p>We met in our friend Annika’s backyard through Cru. Jennie joined Cru her freshman year and after one of the first weekly meetings, a bunch of us went to hang out at Annika’s house and we ended up talking for about 15 minutes around a campfire. There were a few exchanges throughout the rest of the semester (most of which involved Jennie asking Tim for a phone charger), but we really started to talk and get to know each other at the end of the semester leading into winter break.
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What was your first “official” date?
</strong></p><p>Our first date was in February 2018. We went out to dinner at Pi Craft, Jennie’s favorite restaurant, then got frozen yogurt at Abbots next door. Afterwards, we walked across the street to the movie theater and watched the Greatest Showman. Our second date came about 3 months later…..
</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>What was the beginning of your relationship like?</strong><br></p><p>Weird. We first met in September 2017, but started to become friends that December. We told each other we liked each other in January 2018...but decided to remain friends at first. (Jennie might have wanted the friend phase to last longer than Tim did). Jennie finally gave in, and we started officially dating in May of 2018 (after months of going on weekly not date dates to Pi Craft).
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How did Tim propose?
</strong></p><p>Our proposal first started with a re-creation of our first date: Pi Craft, Abbots, and taking a walk over to the movie theater (that at the time was closed due to COVID). Tim took Jennie to a parking lot at RIT (I know… weird... but there’s a backstory) where he had built a little set with lights and pictures. We slow-danced to one of our favorite songs (it’ll be our first dance song) and then Tim proposed. Jennie said yes (of course… you’re on our wedding website), followed up by being surprised by her best friend, Allie, and RIT public safety showing up (don’t worry, they were in on it too).
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Do you both have an unhealthy obsession with milk?
</strong></p><p>How dare you. Milk is great. Fun fact, we don’t drink the same percentage milk. (If you have no idea what we’re talking about, just know that we drink an abnormal amount of milk for adults).
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What are some of your most memorable dates?
</strong></p><p>We’ve spent a day in Boston and a day in Canada, which were both a lot of fun. We also love doing $5 Walmart gift challenges (who can get the best gift with $5 in 30 minutes). Outdoor adventures like Watkins Glen, Chimney Bluffs, and Darien Lake are also great. This Valentine’s Day, Tim got Jennie a scratch off date book and we’ve had a lot of fun doing those together.
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What activities do you like to do together?
</strong></p><p>Cooking, going on walks together,  going to parks (sometimes for disc golf), our church community group (and serving in church ministries), board games, Instacart shopping, watching TV (not movies), hanging out with friends, and other random adventures together.
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What’s your favorite thing to cook together?
</strong></p><p>We love to cook together (so much so that we have a dedicated tablet for all our recipes). Margarita flatbreads, Instant Pot Tuscan Chicken, Zucchini Ciabatta Paninis, and skillet cookies are a few of our favorites. We also love having company to make food for so let us know when you wanna come!
</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What has been the biggest challenge in your relationship thus far?
</strong></p><p>One of us is a big extrovert and likes people….the other one is an introvert who likes to have lots of down time. If you spend more than 30 seconds with us…..it’s really obvious who is who. Working through that dynamic of how to do life together while supporting each other in our differences has been challenging but worth it. Tim taught Jennie how to slow down and rest - that it’s okay to say no sometimes, while Jennie has pushed Tim outside his comfort zone and taught him how to appreciate time with other people more.
